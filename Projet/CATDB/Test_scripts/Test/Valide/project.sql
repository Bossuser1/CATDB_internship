Symptoms of virus infection are characterized by a constricted tap root and a massive proliferation of fine rootlets that often undergo necrosis. BNYVV RNA-3 encodes a 25 kDa (p25) which is an important determinant of leaf symptom phenotype. It also governs BNYVV invasion of the plant root system and induction of rootlet proliferation in sugar beet.In order to obtain a better understanding of molecular aspects of disease development in roots and to characterize specific host genes involved in response to viral infection, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressors of p25 viral protein was obtained and better characterized. It was shown that transgenic plants that efficiently expressed p25 protein produced more lateral roots. Comparative analysis (microarray) was performed between wild type Arabidopsis roots and transgenic Arabidopsis roots expressing p25 protein, in order to identify Arabidopsis genes differentially expressed in response to p25 viral protein.",0,"2005-08-05","2010-11-08","None","None");

CULLIN1, the only cullin protein studied so far in plants, has been shown to be essential for plant development and to play a role in multiple signalling cascades. Here, we report on the first molecular and genetic characterisation of a plant Cullin 3. In contrast to fungi and animals, the genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains two related CULLIN 3 genes, called CUL3A and CUL3B. We found that CUL3A is ubiquitously expressed in plants and that the CUL3A protein is also able to interact with RBX1 and certain Arabidopsis BTB-domain proteins. In order to determine the role of CUL3A in plant development, we used a reverse genetic approach and identified T-DNA insertion mutants. cul3a null mutants flower slightly latter than the control plants and their hypocotyls exhibit a reduced sensitivity to far red light.

We found that CUL3A is ubiquitously expressed in plants and that the CUL3A protein is also able to interact with RBX1 and certain Arabidopsis BTB-domain proteins. In order to determine the role of CUL3A in plant development, we used a reverse genetic approach and identified T-DNA insertion mutants. cul3a null mutants flower slightly latter than the control plants and their hypocotyls exhibit a reduced sensitivity to far red light.

A slow growth phase during which a thick polylamellated wall is deposited and a rapid growth phase during which cell wall polymers are extensively remodelled. In dark-grown hypocotyls the slow growth phase takes place during the first 48h after seed-imbibition synchronously in all cells. At 48h after imbibition, cells at the basis of the hypocotyl undergo a growth acceleration, this acceleration follows an acropetal gradient along the hypocotyl. In this experiment, we investigated the changes in transcript abundance that accompany this sudden increase in growth rate.2. Study the feed-back mechanisms involved in the coordination between  cellulose synthesis and the cell elongation. The inhibition of cellulose using chemical inhibitors also inhibits cell elongation. In the same study (Refregier et al., 2004), we have observed that the effect of the cellulose synthesis inhibitor isoxaben on cell elongation is different dependent on the growth stage. When applied during the slow growth phase, cells continue to elongate slowly and do not show the growth acceleration at 48h after imbibition. Surprisingly, when applied after the growth acceleration, isoxaben does not inhibit subsequent growth. In this study we compared the effects of isoxaben on the transcript profiles before and after the growth acceleration.

Major mycotoxins produced by the fungus are trichothecens, including deoxynivalenol (DON). In our laboratory, we use Brachypodium distachyon as a model plant for cereals because of its amenability (short life cycle, numerous genomic and genetic resources, ...). We have recently shown that F. graminearum does induce head blight symptoms on this species and that DON is produced on infected spikes.

Global gene expression profiling of root cells using microarray analysis will be conducted to identify genes expressed during root branching. First, analysing the differential gene expression between the wild type and the mutant both at low and high level of nitrate, we will identify genes of root development but also genes specifically involved in nitrate response.

These genes will be compared to those found to be expressed in the wild type roots under submitted to various nitrogen sources (Ruffel et al., 2008).
